            <h1>Hi, I'm John</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>I'm a software engineer and freelance web and mobile app developer passionate about building sophisticated yet accessible programs to meet the needs of the end user. Through obtaining a bachelors in literature, a degree in military science at Georgetown, and serving as a Army engineer and an Army Ranger for four years, I gained extensive analytical and project management skills, and an ability to solve technical challenges with precision. Having studied software engineering both academically and as an obsession, I left the military and moved to Silicon Valley to practice development at the highest level. If you need a developer for your project, I would love to hear about it.</p>
